# Ricknmorty

This is a practical exercise in using Angular, consuming the Rick and Morty API, and employing various Angular and web techniques. These include components, services, routes, and directives. I utilized both classic directives with syntax within the HTML tag, such as *ngIf, and new implementations from recent Angular versions, like @if () { }.

Additionally, I incorporated CSS transitions and animations, as well as Angular route transitions.

## Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
